</p>

The base code can be found at this link: https://snack.expo.dev/@linxsystems/tech-1---simple-image-upload-ui

- [ ] **Req 1**: Keep track of the "uploading" or "not uploading" status of the app.

- [ ] **Req 3**: If "not uploading", display an image with given image source and disable the cancel button. 
- [ ] **Req 4**: Add in onPress functionality to the buttons to toggle the "uploading"/"not uploading" status.
- [ ] **Req 5**: Display the Upload and Cancel buttons along the same row (instead of column).
