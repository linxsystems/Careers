    <img src="./assets/Mobile-Tech-1-1.png" alt="tech-1-1" title="not uploading">
    <img src="./assets/Mobile-Tech-1-2.png" alt="tech-1-2" title="uploading">
</p>

The base code can be found at this link: https://snack.expo.dev/@linxsystems/tech-1---simple-image-upload-ui

- [ ] **Req 1**: Keep track of the "uploading" or "not uploading" status of the app.
- [ ] **Req 2**: If "uploading", display a basic indicator (text like "Uploading..." will do) and disable the Upload button. The indicator should be centered in a view of given image size.
- [ ] **Req 3**: If "not uploading", display an image with given image source and disable the cancel button. 
- [ ] **Req 4**: Add in onPress functionality to the buttons to toggle the "uploading"/"not uploading" status.
- [ ] **Req 5**: Display the Upload and Cancel buttons along the same row (instead of column).
