# Technical 1 - Backend
Congratulations! You have progressed to our technical #1 challenge. In this challenge, your task is to code-ify the decoder ring shown below. The decoder ring is a tool that allows you to decode secret encoded messages. In order to read a secret message, you will need two things: **a cipher** and an **encoded message**.

Here is how to use the decoder:
1. Place the inner ring inside of the outer ring
2. For each encoded message, there will be a cipher. The cipher will consist of two letters that need to be lined up. In the example below, we used the cipher E = X. You can see that both instances of E and X in the inner and outer ring line up. This will be the case for any letter pairing you choose for the cipher.
3. There will also be an encoded message. In order to decode the message, you must replace each letter from the encoded message with new letters found on the decoder ring. For example, if the encoded message was ZNYX, the decoded message would be CODE (Z → C, N → O, Y → D, X → E).
