## Step 1: Send in Resume
Hopefully you have already done this. If not, please email it to careers@linxsystems.com. We use your resume to get an idea of your education, skills, and previous experience.

## Step 2: Technical 1
We ask that all applicants complete an initial technical challenge. We expect this to take up to 30 minutes. For starters, this weeds out the resume spammers and saves us time. Secondly, we'll have another item to talk to you about during the interview. And lastly, we hope that you have fun with your challenge. Our development team enjoyed putting these challenges together for you and we look forward to seeing your response!

Please complete the relevant section for the job you are applying for and follow the instructions within your challenge for how to submit your answer.

- [Mobile App Developer](Technical_1_Mobile.md)
- [Backend Developer](Technical_1_Backend.md)
- [Farm Management App Developer](Technical_1_Backend.md)

## Step 3: Short Questionnaire
Upon a successful submission of the Technical 1 challenge, you will receive a short list of questions so that we can get to know you a little better.

## Step 4: Interview
If you have been selected for an interview, you will be notified by the hiring manager. The interview typically takes around 30 minutes and will either be conducted in person at our Bloomington, IL office or via video call.

## Step 5: Technical 2
You've aced the first technical and piqued our interest in the interview. Now we want to see how well we work together. This assessment takes between 60-90 minutes. It will be a real-world experience where you will get a feel for what a normal day at Linx Systems would be like.

## Step 6: Hired!
Congratulations! You are a great fit at Linx Systems and we are thrilled for you to be joining us. Specific next steps will be sent over including an employment contract.
